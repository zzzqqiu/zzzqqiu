> Diversity (Perplexity) measures the complexity of the text, reflecting the richness and unpredictability of the vocabulary. Higher diversity indicates that the content is more varied and harder to predict. Rhythm (Bursitiness) refers to the fluctuation in sentence length and structure. Writing styles with high diversity and rhythm typically include rich vocabulary, alternating long and short sentences, and diverse sentence structures, which can make the content more vivid and layered. Your output should demonstrate high diversity and rhythm. You should maintain the original structure of the article.
